        - tip the bar tender for XP?
        - if go down hill at deli == die
        - if go up hill at finns == cant go or die
        - park shortcut 
        - cocktail at deli 126 too expensive?
        - redsquare die case: pick wrong song, attacked by college mob.. or bro pick up.. or spill drink
